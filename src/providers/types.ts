 * Compose the prompt actually sent to the vision/speech model.
 *
 * The built-in prompt goes FIRST and the tenant's instruction is appended as
 * additional focus, never as a replacement. Generic OCR reliably captures the
 * headline number on a receipt and routinely garbles the small print — a
 * reference id, a last-4, a bank name — so naming those fields materially
 * improves extraction. But the base task has to stay anchored: an instruction
 * that quietly replaced it would turn "read this attachment" into whatever the
 * tenant last typed, and every other conversation would silently lose its OCR.
 *
 * Extraction only. Nothing here decides anything — see the note in the README
 * about not using this as a payment approval gate.
